WSO2 for PHP installation on Centos 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install openssl and httpd. Most likely they will be already installed in your linux distro.
	yum -y install httpd openssl

2. Install the required libs
	yum -y install php php-xml gcc php-devel openssl-devel libxml2-devel

3. Download and unzip the sources from this repository
4. cd to the directory with the sources and run the below commands to compile and install
	./configure
	make
	make install

5. Copy the scripts
	cp -R ./scripts/* /usr/share/php

6.Now a new module has been created and copied to the php modules folder and all we have to do is include it in our php configuration so we create a new file for this purpose:
	touch /etc/php.d/wsf.ini
	echo "extension=wsf.so" > /etc/php.d/wsf.ini
	service httpd restart

7.Lastly you have to open the appropriate firewall ports (if they are not open laready):
	system-config-firewall-tui -> customize -> check "WWW" and "Secure WWW" -> close -> ok -> yes

8.(Re)start the web server:
	service httpd restart
	chkconfig httpd on

9. Copy the samples
	cp -R ./samples /var/www/html

10. Test the installation by opening http://<server>/samples  in your browser. If you get an error 505 or any other error try restarting your web server:
